# Fix for Cloudinary Upload Error

## ðŸš¨ Problem
You're getting the error: **"Upload preset must be whitelisted for unsigned uploads"**

This happens because the upload preset in your Cloudinary account is not configured to allow unsigned uploads from the frontend.

## ðŸ”§ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Configure Cloudinary Upload Preset

1. **Log into your Cloudinary Dashboard**
   - Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
   - Sign in with your account (using cloud name: `dwwbegf2y`)

2. **Navigate to Upload Settings**
   - Go to **Settings** â†’ **Upload**
   - Scroll down to **Upload presets** section

3. **Create or Edit the `rental_images` preset**
   
   **If the preset doesn't exist:**
   - Click **"Add upload preset"**
   - Set **Preset name**: `rental_images`
   
   **If the preset exists:**
   - Click on the existing `rental_images` preset to edit it

4. **Configure the preset with these settings:**
   ```
   Preset name: rental_images
   Signing Mode: Unsigned âœ… (This is CRITICAL)
   Folder: property_listings
   Format: Auto
   Quality: Auto
   Resource type: Image
   
   Transformations:
   - Max width: 1200px
   - Max height: 800px
   - Crop mode: Limit
   ```

5. **Save the preset**
   - Click **"Save"** button

### Step 2: Alternative Quick Fix

If you can't access the Cloudinary dashboard right now, you can temporarily use these alternative preset names that are commonly available:

1. **ml_default** - Usually available on most Cloudinary accounts
2. **unsigned_preset** - Basic preset name

The code has been updated to try these alternatives automatically.

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file has the correct values:

```env
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dwwbegf2y
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=416313624663736
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=rental_images
```

### Step 4: Test the Upload

1. **Restart your development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Try uploading an image again**
   - The system will now try multiple upload strategies
   - You should see better error messages
   - Loading and success notifications will appear

## ðŸ”„ Code Changes Made

1. **Updated default preset name** from `unsigned_preset` to `rental_images`
2. **Added multiple upload strategies** - tries different presets automatically
3. **Improved error handling** with specific error messages
4. **Added toast notifications** for better user feedback
5. **Added loading indicators** during upload

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Try uploading these file types to test:
- âœ… JPEG/JPG images (up to 15MB)
- âœ… PNG images (up to 15MB)  
- âœ… WebP images (up to 15MB)

## ðŸ“ž If Still Not Working

If you still get errors after configuring the upload preset:

1. **Check browser console** for detailed error messages
2. **Try with a smaller image** (under 5MB)
3. **Verify internet connection**
4. **Contact Cloudinary support** if the preset configuration isn't working

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Behavior After Fix

- âœ… Images upload successfully
- âœ… Progress bars show during upload
- âœ… Success notifications appear
- âœ… Images appear in the gallery
- âœ… Cover image can be set
- âœ… Error messages are user-friendly

The system will now automatically try multiple upload methods, so even if one preset fails, it will try others until it finds one that works.
